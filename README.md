# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and Github.

Pipeline project developed with a [Jenkins Shared Libraries](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) focus. Nontheless, the code can be integrated with a Java-Spring based microservice that follows a standard Maven structure. "vars" folder cointains the pipeline's code programmed in groovy language. Alternatively, there is a second branch with a different pipeline with the same goal.

### Project lab developed in collaboration with [Grupo3-Usach](https://github.com/Grupo3-Devops-Usach/pipelines-devops-lab).
